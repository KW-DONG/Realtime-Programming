# Roads Damages Detector

## Project Overview:
The Roads Damages Detector project aims to develop a mobile application that uses roads damages detection technology to detect and classify road damages such as potholes, cracks, and other issues in real-time. The application will be designed to be efficient and user-friendly, helping road maintenance crews to identify and repair road damages more quickly. The detection algorithm will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi and operate in real-time, with the location of each damage recorded via a GNSS module and a report generated after each detection mission.

## Backgroundsï¼š
There are three types of roads damages: alligator cracks, linear cracks and pothole cracks. The repair methods and task urgency of these threes are different, it is necessary to do investigations before taking action.
